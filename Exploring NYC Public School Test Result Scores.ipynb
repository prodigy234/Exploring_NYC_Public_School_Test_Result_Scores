There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n\n# Start coding here...\n# Add as many cells as you like...\n\n#Save your results in a pandas DataFrame called best_math_schools, including “school_name” and “average_math” columns, sorted by “average_math” in descending order.\nbest_math_schools = schools[schools['average_math'] >= 640][['school_name', 'average_math']].sort_values('average_math', ascending=False)\nbest_math_schools\n\n\n#Save your results as a pandas DataFrame called top_10_schools containing the “school_name” and a new column named “total_SAT”, with results ordered by “total_SAT” in descending order.\nschools['total_SAT'] = schools['average_math'] + schools['average_reading'] + schools['average_writing']\ntop_10_schools = schools[['school_name', 'total_SAT']]\ntop_10_schools = top_10_schools.sort_values('total_SAT', ascending=False).head(10)\ntop_10_schools\n\n\n#Save your results as a pandas DataFrame called largest_std_dev\n#The DataFrame should contain one row, with:\n#“borough” — the name of the NYC borough with the largest standard deviation of “total_SAT”.\n#“num_schools” — the number of schools in the borough.\n#“average_SAT” — the mean of “total_SAT”.\n#“std_SAT” — the standard deviation of “total_SAT”.\n#Round all numeric values to two decimal places.\n\nboroughs = schools.groupby('borough')['total_SAT'].agg(['count', 'mean', 'std']).round(2)\nvalue = boroughs['std'].max()\nlargest_std_dev = boroughs[boroughs['std'] == value]\nlargest_std_dev = largest_std_dev.rename(columns={\"count\":\"num_schools\", \"mean\":\"average_SAT\", \"std\":\"std_SAT\"})\nlargest_std_dev.reset_index(inplace=True)\n","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","executionTime":27,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n\n# Start coding here...\n# Add as many cells as you like...\n\n#Save your results in a pandas DataFrame called best_math_schools, including “school_name” and “average_math” columns, sorted by “average_math” in descending order.\nbest_math_schools = schools[schools['average_math'] >= 640][['school_name', 'average_math']].sort_values('average_math', ascending=False)\nbest_math_schools\n\n\n#Save your results as a pandas DataFrame called top_10_schools containing the “school_name” and a new column named “total_SAT”, with results ordered by “total_SAT” in descending order.\nschools['total_SAT'] = schools['average_math'] + schools['average_reading'] + schools['average_writing']\ntop_10_schools = schools[['school_name', 'total_SAT']]\ntop_10_schools = top_10_schools.sort_values('total_SAT', ascending=False).head(10)\ntop_10_schools\n\n\n#Save your results as a pandas DataFrame called largest_std_dev\n#The DataFrame should contain one row, with:\n#“borough” — the name of the NYC borough with the largest standard deviation of “total_SAT”.\n#“num_schools” — the number of schools in the borough.\n#“average_SAT” — the mean of “total_SAT”.\n#“std_SAT” — the standard deviation of “total_SAT”.\n#Round all numeric values to two decimal places.\n\nboroughs = schools.groupby('borough')['total_SAT'].agg(['count', 'mean', 'std']).round(2)\nvalue = boroughs['std'].max()\nlargest_std_dev = boroughs[boroughs['std'] == value]\nlargest_std_dev = largest_std_dev.rename(columns={\"count\":\"num_schools\", \"mean\":\"average_SAT\", \"std\":\"std_SAT\"})\nlargest_std_dev.reset_index(inplace=True)\n","executionCancelledAt":null,"lastExecutedAt":1715377437020,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":321,"type":"dataFrame"}},"lastExecutedByKernel":"12e13436-64cf-4e4e-9693-de2298f168b5"},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"editor":"DataLab"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
